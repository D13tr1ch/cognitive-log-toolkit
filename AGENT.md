🧠 AGENT.md – Cognitive Layer Declaration

This project was architected using a reasoning system authored by D13tr1ch, with assistance from modular AI tooling for scaffolding and reflection.

No embedded or executable AI agent is included in this repository.

🧬 Identity and Origin
	•	Agent Style: Cognitive Mirror + Diagnostic Builder
	•	Primary Author: D13tr1ch
	•	Methodology: System designed using human-curated logic, aligned with a 19-point Master Priority List, licensed under the Cognitive Fingerprint License (CFL v1.0).
	•	Tools Used: AI scaffolding via prompt iteration, but no live models, training data, or generative services are embedded in this code.

🛑 What This Agent Is Not
	•	❌ This is not an AI bot, API, chatbot, or decision-making agent
	•	❌ This project does not include any live model weights or inference logic
	•	❌ There is no LLM pipeline running in this toolkit

⸻

✅ What This Agent Represents
	•	✔ A structured personality-driven reasoning system
	•	✔ Authored scaffolds built around an expressive logic fingerprint
	•	✔ Modular scripts that reflect deliberate thinking, not automation

⸻

🤝 If AI Is Added Later…

Should you (or a contributor) add a live AI layer, please:
	•	Document its decision boundaries
	•	Credit the foundational author (D13tr1ch)
	•	Maintain the cognitive licensing structure
